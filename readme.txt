The new Gutenberg editor is here, and with it comes the new block editor.

We have built the theme so you can simply select a block and place it wherever you wish in your editor, style to your taste and you are done!

== Fully Gutenberg Compatible ==

The LSX theme has been redeveloped for the WordPress Gutenberg update. This means you can now make use of the drag-and-drop page builder when creating new pages and posts. 

Our LSX Blocks Plugin comes with a range of custom Gutenberg blocks. These blocks are designed to display perfectly with the LSX theme.

== LSX Extensions ==

Our range of powerful [LSX extensions](https://lsx.lsdev.biz/extensions/) gives you freedom to add team members, client reviews, your portfolio and so much more to your website. Each extension is designed fluidly with the LSX theme. So theres no code hassles involved.
