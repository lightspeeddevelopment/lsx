The new Gutenberg editor is here, and with it comes the new block editor.

We have built the theme so you can simply drag and drop them into your editor, configure to your wishes and you are done!

== Fully Gutenberg Compatible ==

The LSX theme has been redeveloped for the WordPress Gutenberg update. This means you can now make use of the drag-and-drop page builder when creating new pages and posts. 

Our LSX Blocks Plugin comes with a range of custom Gutenberg blocks. These blocks are designed to display perfectly with the LSX theme.
